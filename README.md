# Weather App

This is a simple weather app with a Node.js backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

## How to run locally

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
2. In the `backend` folder, run:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm start`
3. Open `weatherFront.html` in your browser.

## How it works
- The backend fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
- The frontend requests weather data from the backend.

## Deployment
To make your backend always available, deploy it to a cloud service (see below).
